Divide & Conquer Problems
(1) Divide the problem into several smaller subproblems
Normally, the subproblems are similar to the original

(2) Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively 
Base case: solve small enough problems by brute force

(3) Combine the solutions to get a solution to the subproblems
And finally a solution to the original problem

(4) Divide and Conquer algorithms are normally recursive
